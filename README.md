# Community Digital Infrastructure Game

## Overview

Welcome to the **Community Digital Infrastructure Game**! This interactive, choose-your-own-adventure experience is designed to teach you about the complexities and challenges of funding and managing large-scale public goods and digital infrastructure projects.

### What You Will Learn

In this game, you will explore key concepts related to both traditional and digital infrastructure funding, including:

- **Public Goods**: Understand what public goods are and why they are essential for communities.
- **Physical Infrastructure Funding**: Learn how traditional infrastructure projects, like building schools or parks, are funded through municipal bonds.
- **Digital Infrastructure Funding**: Discover how decentralized communities fund digital public goods projects, such as decentralized oracle services, using modern blockchain-based methods.
- **Restaking and EigenLayer**: Explore how staked assets (like ETH) are reused to secure additional services or networks, and how EigenLayer enables validators to extend their security to multiple services.
- **EigenPods**: Learn how EigenPods help manage and optimize restaked assets across various decentralized services.
- **SSV (Secret Shared Validator)**: Understand how SSV technology ensures the security and decentralized management of validators by distributing control among multiple operators.

### Game Background

When a government entity or a decentralized community aims to create a large-scale public good or digital public good infrastructure project, they must efficiently raise resources, manage project execution, ensure accountability, and secure long-term sustainability. The key players involved in these processes—such as contributors, organizers, developers, and users—must align their efforts to achieve the project’s goals.

The challenge is to implement a system that ensures proper resource allocation, timely project completion, and ongoing support for the infrastructure developed.

### How to Play

1. **Choose Your Adventure**: As you progress, make choices that affect the funding, development, and sustainability of infrastructure projects. Your decisions will guide you through different paths, each with its own challenges and outcomes.
2. **Set Up an EigenPod with SSV**: Along your journey, you’ll learn how to set up an EigenPod using SSV technology, ensuring your staked assets are securely managed while generating yield for your digital infrastructure project.
3. **Explore Funding Models**: Compare and contrast traditional municipal bonds with digital infrastructure funds.
4. **Achieve the Project’s Goals**: Successfully fund, build, and maintain a public good project, ensuring long-term benefits for the community.

By playing this game, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how infrastructure projects—both physical and digital—are funded, developed, and sustained. Whether you're interested in traditional public goods or the cutting-edge world of blockchain-based digital infrastructure, this game offers valuable insights and practical knowledge. Enjoy your adventure as you navigate the complexities of funding, setting up an EigenPod with SSV, and more!
